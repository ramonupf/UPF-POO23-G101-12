# Solution Documentation for Sports Competition Simulation

## 1. Introduction

As in the previous Labs, we are continuing to develop a Java program designed to simulate various types of sports competitions, such as leagues, cups, and group plays. The main objective is to manage teams, players, matches, and statistics dynamically. Key classes of this 4th lab include `Team`, `TeamStats`, `Player`, `PlayerStats`, `Goalkeeper`, `Outfielder`, `GoalkeeperStats`, `OutfielderStats`, and the implementation of the `Comparable` interface.

### Key Classes and Methods

- **Team and TeamStats**: Handle team-related information and statistics.
- **Player and PlayerStats**: Represent individual players and their statistics.
- **Goalkeeper and Outfielder**: Specialized classes for different player types.
- **GoalkeeperStats and OutfielderStats**: Specific statistics for goalkeepers and outfielders.
- **update, updateStats, printStats, printTable, compareTo**: Essential methods for updating statistics, printing information, and comparing objects.

## 2. Solution Description and Theoretical Concepts

We have used inheritance and polymorphism. By creating abstract classes and methods (`Player`, `PlayerStats`) and extending them (`Goalkeeper`, `Outfielder`, `GoalkeeperStats`, `OutfielderStats`), the program achieves a high degree of reusability and scalability. The use of interfaces like `Comparable` allows for sorting objects based on defined criteria, crucial for ranking players and teams.

**Object-Oriented Concepts:**

- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding is enforced through protected and private attributes.
- **Inheritance**: Subclasses extend the functionalities of parent classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods like `updateStats` are overridden in child classes to provide specific functionalities.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract methods like `printStats` in parent classes are defined in subclasses.

### Implementation of Methods

- **update and updateStats**: These methods ensure real-time updates to player and team statistics post-match simulation.
- **printStats and printTable**: Provide formatted outputs for player statistics and league tables.
- **compareTo**: Facilitates the comparison of `PlayerStats` and `TeamStats` objects, they are necessary for ranking and sorting operations.

## 3. Conclusion

### Effectiveness of the Solution

The implemented classes passed all the test scenarios, indicating a successful implementation. The program efficiently manages different aspects of a sports competition, from simulating matches to updating and presenting statistics. You can see this in the main program, where we try to add different players to teams where they are not supposed to be allowed.

### Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was ensuring the consistency of data across various classes, especially during updates post-match simulations. Implementing the `Comparable` interface in `PlayerStats` and `TeamStats` also required careful consideration of various comparison criteria.
